        <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">
          PL8CHAT was created to connect drivers, vehicles, and businesses through license plate–based communication. Protecting your privacy is central to that mission. This Privacy Policy explains how PL8CHAT, LLC (“PL8CHAT,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and safeguards your personal information when you use our websites, mobile applications, and related services (the “App”). <br /><br /> By using PL8CHAT, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br />
        </span>

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />1. Eligibility and Age<br /> <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">The App is intended for individuals 17 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 17. If we become aware that information has been provided by a minor under 17, we will delete it promptly.
        </span></span><br />

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />2. Information We Collect<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">
          When you create or use an account, we may collect the following categories of information.<br /><br />

          Basic account information. We collect your name, email address, phone number, and password.<br /><br />

          Identity verification information. If you choose to verify your identity, we collect a photo of your state-issued driver’s license or ID card and a selfie to confirm your identity matches the ID. At this stage, our verification process is limited to checking that the face in the selfie matches the photo on the ID. Although the ID contains your name and address, we do not actively use that information unless you later choose to verify a vehicle.<br /><br />

          Vehicle verification information. If you choose to add a vehicle, you enter your license plate number and state of issuance, and you upload a photo of your vehicle registration. At that point, we cross-reference the information on the registration against the driver’s license or state ID you previously provided, confirming that the license plate matches, and that the name and address on the registration match the name and address on the ID.<br /><br />

          Business account information. For business accounts, we collect the business name, address, and contact information of the authorized representative, including their name, email address, and phone number. Business emails must be verified as part of the registration process.<br /><br />

          Technical information. We may collect device type, operating system, IP address, and general usage activity.<br /><br />

          When you provide sensitive information such as IDs, selfies, or vehicle registrations, we may also present a Notice at Collection in the App at the time of upload. This provides a summary of the information being collected and links back to this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />

        </span></span>
        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />3. How We Use Information<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">We use the information we collect to:</span></span>
        <ul className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal list-disc translate-x-7">
          <li>Create and maintain accounts.</li>
          <li>Verify identities and confirm vehicle ownership.</li>
          <li>Enable communication between drivers and businesses.</li>
          <li>Monitor, detect, and prevent fraud, misuse, or unsafe behavior.</li>
          <li>Improve the App and develop new features.</li>
          <li>Communicate about account activity, safety updates, and promotions.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal requirements and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />4. How We Share Information<br /></span>
        <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">We do not sell your personal information. We may share information:<br /></span>
        <ul className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal list-disc translate-x-7">
          <li>With other users as required to enable PL8CHAT’s features, such as displaying license plate profiles or messaging.</li>
          <li>With trusted service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting, identity verification, analytics, or communications.</li>
          <li>When required by law, subpoena, or legal process, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of users, the public, or PL8CHAT.</li>
          <li>In connection with a business transfer, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
        </ul>

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />5. Sensitive Information and Security<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">We treat driver’s license images, selfies, and vehicle registration documents as sensitive personal information. These files are encrypted during transmission and storage. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only, using role-based access controls. PL8CHAT designs its systems to minimize unnecessary access and to prevent casual browsing of sensitive identifiers. While no system is entirely secure, we implement technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards to protect your information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</span></span><br />

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />6. Access to Information (Role-Based Access)<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">Access to sensitive information (such as IDs, selfies, and registration images) is limited to personnel with a documented need-to-know:</span></span>
        <ul className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal list-disc translate-x-7">
          <li>Trust & Safety may access to investigate safety reports, fraud, or policy violations.</li>
          <li>Limited Support may access minimal data necessary to resolve user account issues.</li>
          <li>Compliance/Legal may access as required to satisfy legal obligations or respond to lawful requests.</li>
          <li>Engineering may access on a temporary, “break-glass” basis for critical operational needs, subject to prior approval and post-access review.</li>
        </ul><br />
        <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">All such access is permissioned, logged, and periodically reviewed. PL8CHAT prohibits casual or exploratory access to user data.<br /></span>

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />7. Business Accounts<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">Businesses that register on PL8CHAT must provide accurate company details. For business accounts, the business name and address become visible and searchable within the App so that users can identify and contact the business. Business account information is also visible to PL8CHAT and may be visible to consumers when they interact with the business through the App. Businesses are responsible for ensuring that their representatives are authorized and for any communications sent to consumers through PL8CHAT.</span></span><br />

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />8. Your Choices and Rights<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">You may access and update your account information at any time through the App. You may opt out of promotional communications by following the instructions in those messages or by contacting us directly.<br /><br />

          Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights under privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), including the right to request access to your personal information, the right to request deletion of your personal information, the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to limit the use of sensitive personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us at info@pl8chat.com.</span></span><br />

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />9. Data Retention<br /><span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. <br /><br />

          Sensitive identity and vehicle verification images (IDs, selfies, and registrations) are retained only for as long as necessary to verify your account and protect the platform against fraud and abuse. Our default practice is to retain these images for up to 90 days after verification and then delete or irreversibly redact them. We retain minimal derived verification metadata (for example, confirmation that the ID matched the selfie and that the registration matched the entered plate, along with timestamps) for safety, audit, and legal purposes. We may preserve information longer when required by law, to comply with a legal hold, or in connection with an active investigation. <br /><br />

          You may request deletion of your information at any time, subject to our need to retain certain information to comply with law or to ensure the safety and integrity of the platform.</span></span> <br />

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />10. Cookies and Tracking Technologies<br /></span>
        <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">
          At this time, PL8CHAT does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies. If this changes, we will update this Policy and, where legally required, provide notice and options.<br />
        </span>

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />11. Third-Party Links and Services<br /></span>
        <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">
          The App may link to or integrate with third-party services. We are not responsible for their privacy practices; please review their policies.<br />
        </span>

        <span className="text-black text-sm font-semibold leading-normal"><br />12. Changes to this Policy<br /></span>
        <span className="text-black text-sm font-normal leading-normal">
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of PL8CHAT after updates take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.<br />
